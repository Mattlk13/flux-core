/* shell signal handling
 *
 * Setup disposition for signals in the shell.
 * Currently,
 *
 * SIGINT  - forward to all local tasks
 * SIGTERM - forward
 * SIGALRM - forward
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * By setting up the signal watchers during "shell.init", there is the
 * potential for inconsistent exit codes if a signal is received before all
 * tasks have started.  For example, this could be seen with something
 * like:
 *
 * jobid=`flux submit -n1000 foo.sh`
 * flux job raise --type=foo --severity=0 $jobid
 *
 * i.e. raise sends SIGTERM to job/shell immediately after starting,
 * but due to the large task count of 1000, the signal is received
 * before tasks are all setup.  Some tasks could receive SIGTERM while
 * some (to be created ones) do not.
 *
 * Note that the shell should always return an error, but the error
 * may not be consistent.  This situation is extremely rare and only
 * seen is testing situations such as the above.  So we elect to not
 * fix this race.
