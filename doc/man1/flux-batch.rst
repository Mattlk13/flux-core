SYNOPSIS
========

**flux** **batch** [OPTIONS] SCRIPT ...

**flux** **batch** [OPTIONS] --wrap COMMAND ...


DESCRIPTION
===========

.. program:: flux batch

:program:`flux-batch` submits *SCRIPT* to run as the initial program of a Flux
subinstance.  *SCRIPT* refers to a file that is copied at the time of
submission.  Once resources are allocated, *SCRIPT* executes on the first
node of the allocation, with any remaining free arguments supplied as *SCRIPT*
arguments.  Once *SCRIPT* exits, the Flux subinstance exits and resources are
released to the enclosing Flux instance.

If there are no free arguments, the script is read from standard input.

If the :option:`--wrap` option is used, the script is created by wrapping the
free arguments or standard input in a shell script prefixed with ``#!/bin/sh``.

If the job request is accepted, its jobid is printed on standard output and the
command returns.  The job runs when the Flux scheduler fulfills its resource
allocation request.  :man1:`flux-jobs` may be used to display the job status.

Flux commands that are run from the batch script refer to the subinstance.
For example, :man1:`flux-run` would launch work there.  A Flux command run
from the script can be forced to refer to the enclosing instance by supplying
the :option:`flux --parent` option.

Flux commands outside of the batch script refer to their enclosing instance,
often a system instance.  :man1:`flux-proxy` establishes a connection to a
running subinstance by jobid, then spawns a shell in which Flux commands refer
to the subinstance.  For example:

::

   $ flux uptime
    07:48:42 run 2.1d,  owner flux,  depth 0,  size 8
   $ flux batch -N 2 --queue=batch mybatch.sh
   ƒM7Zq9AKHno
   $ flux proxy ƒM7Zq9AKHno
   $ flux uptime
    07:47:18 run 1.6m,  owner user42,  depth 1,  size 2
   $ flux top
   ...
   $ exit
   $

Other commands accept a jobid argument and establish the connection
automatically.  For example:

::

   $ flux batch -N 2 --queue=batch mybatch.sh
   ƒM7Zq9AKHno
   $ flux top ƒM7Zq9AKHno
   ...
   $

Batch scripts may contain submission directives denoted by ``flux:``
as described in RFC 36.  See `SUBMISSION DIRECTIVES`_ below.

The available OPTIONS are detailed below.

JOB PARAMETERS
==============

:man1:`flux-batch` and :man1:`flux-alloc` do not launch tasks directly, and
therefore job parameters are specified in terms of resource slot size
and number of slots. A resource slot can be thought of as the minimal
resources required for a virtual task. The default slot size is 1 core.

CONSTRAINTS
===========

.. include:: common/job-constraints.rst

DEPENDENCIES
============

.. include:: common/job-dependencies.rst

ENVIRONMENT
===========

By default, these commands duplicate the current environment when submitting
jobs. However, a set of environment manipulation options are provided to
give fine control over the requested environment submitted with the job.

.. include:: common/job-environment.rst

ENV RULES
---------

.. include:: common/job-env-rules.rst

PROCESS RESOURCE LIMITS
=======================

By default these commands propagate some common resource limits (as described
in :linux:man2:`getrlimit`) to the job by setting the ``rlimit`` job shell
option in jobspec.  The set of resource limits propagated can be controlled
via the :option:`--rlimit=RULE` option:

.. include:: common/job-process-resource-limits.rst

EXIT STATUS
===========

The job exit status is normally the batch script exit status.
This result is stored in the KVS.

OTHER OPTIONS
=============

.. include:: common/job-other-batch.rst

SHELL OPTIONS
=============

Some options that affect the parallel runtime environment of the Flux instance
started by :program:`flux batch` are provided by the Flux shell.
These options are described in detail in the
:ref:`SHELL OPTIONS <flux_shell_options>` section of :man1:`flux-shell`.
A list of the most commonly needed options follows.

Usage: :option:`flux batch -o NAME[=ARG]`.

SUBMISSION DIRECTIVES
=====================

The :program:`flux batch` command supports submission directives
mixed within the submission script. The submission directive specification
is fully detailed in RFC 36, but is summarized here for convenience:

 * A submission directive is indicated by a line that starts with
   a prefix of non-alphanumeric characters followed by a tag ``FLUX:`` or
   ``flux:``. The prefix plus tag is called the *directive sentinel*. E.g.,
   in the example below the sentinel is ``# flux:``: ::

     #!/bin/sh
     # flux: -N4 -n16
     flux run -n16 hostname

 * All directives in a file must use the same sentinel pattern, otherwise
   an error will be raised.
 * Directives must be grouped together - it is an error to include a
   directive after any non-blank line that doesn't start with the common
   prefix.
 * The directive starts after the sentinel to the end of the line.
 * The ``#`` character is supported as a comment character in directives.
 * UNIX shell quoting is supported in directives.
 * Triple quoted strings can be used to include newlines and quotes without
   further escaping. If a triple quoted string is used across multiple lines,
   then the opening and closing triple quotes must appear at the end of the
   line. For example ::

     # flux: --setattr=user.conf="""
     # flux: [config]
     # flux:   item = "foo"
     # flux: """

Submission directives may be used to set default command line options for
:program:`flux batch` for a given script. Options given on the command line
override those in the submission script, e.g.: ::

   $ flux batch --job-name=test-name --wrap <<-EOF
   > #flux: -N4
   > #flux: --job-name=name
   > flux run -N4 hostname
   > EOF
   ƒ112345
   $ flux jobs -no {name} ƒ112345
   test-name
