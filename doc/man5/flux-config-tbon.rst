===================
flux-config-tbon(5)
===================


DESCRIPTION
===========

The ``tbon`` table may be used to tune the configuration of the Flux tree-based
overlay network (TBON).

It may contain the following keys:


KEYS
====

torpid_min
   (optional) The amount of time (in RFC 23 Flux Standard Duration format) that
   a broker will allow the connection to its TBON parent to remain idle before
   sending a keepalive message.  The default value of ``5s`` should be
   reasonable in most circumstances.  This configured value may be overridden
   by setting the ``tbon.torpid_min`` broker attribute.

torpid_max
   (optional) The amount of time (in RFC 23 Flux Standard Duration format) that
   a broker will wait for an idle TBON child connection to send messages before
   declaring it torpid  (unresponsive). A value of 0 disables torpid node
   checking.  Torpid nodes are automatically drained and require manual
   undraining with :man1:`flux-resource`.  This configured value may be
   overridden by setting the ``tbon.torpid_max`` broker attribute.


EXAMPLE
=======

::

   [tbon]
   torpid_min = 10s
   torpid_max = 1m
