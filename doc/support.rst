If you have a problem that might be a flux-core bug, please first search
existing issues, then open a new `Github issue

Development Commitment
----------------------

At this time, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has a team of
four full time employees working on flux-core, and several additional employees
and collaborators working on the broader Flux Framework and related research
areas.  LLNL is committed to making Flux a production quality tool for HPC
workload management, and has sustained its investment for over a decade thus
far.

Flux is part of the `TOSS <https://hpc.llnl.gov/documentation/toss>`_
operating system and thus is supported across multiple U.S. national laboratory
facilities.

The Flux team welcomes all users and contributors to the Flux community and
will do its best enable the community to grow and thrive.
